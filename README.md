## 🧺 Supabase Setup (For Uploading Clothes)

To upload your own tops and bottoms, set up Supabase in a few easy steps:

### Step 1: Create a Project

Go to https://supabase.com, sign in, and click New Project.
Copy your Project URL and Anon Key — you’ll use them in your .env file.

### Step 2: Enable Storage

In your Supabase dashboard, go to Storage → Create bucket.
Name it clothing-images and make sure it’s public.

### Step 3 — Create a Table

Go to SQL Editor → New Query and paste this:

```
create table if not exists clothing_items (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  name text,
  category text check (category in ('tops','bottoms')),
  image_url text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

alter table clothing_items enable row level security;

create policy "anon can read" on clothing_items
for select using (true);

create policy "anon can insert" on clothing_items
for insert with check (true);
```

Then click Run.

#### 🐛 Debug: "Row violates row-level security" Error

If you get a "new row violates row-level security" error when uploading images, you need to add storage policies for your buckets.

**Option 1: Using SQL (Faster)**

Go to **Storage → Policies** in your Supabase dashboard and run this SQL:

```sql
-- Allow public access for clothing-images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public access for clothing images" ON storage.objects
  FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'clothing-images');

-- Allow public access for generated-outfits bucket (if you created it)
CREATE POLICY "Public access for generated outfits" ON storage.objects
  FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'generated-outfits');
```

**Option 2: Using the Dashboard UI**

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **Storage** in the left sidebar
2. Click on the **clothing-images** bucket
3. Go to the **Policies** tab
4. Click **New Policy**
5. Choose **"For full customization"**
6. Fill in:
   - **Policy name**: `Public access`
   - **Allowed operation**: Select **ALL** (or check INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - **Target roles**: Leave as `public` or blank
   - **Policy command**: Choose **ALL**
   - **USING expression**: Enter `bucket_id = 'clothing-images'`
7. Click **Review** then **Save policy**
8. Repeat steps 2-7 for the **generated-outfits** bucket (if you have one), using `bucket_id = 'generated-outfits'` in step 6

This allows uploads, reads, and deletes using your anonymous key.

### Step 4: Upload Your Clothes

Open the app, click the folder icon, then choose Upload Tops or Upload Bottoms.
Your images will upload to Supabase and appear in the carousel automatically.

If items don’t show, double-check that your bucket is public and the table policies are correct.

### 🤖 AI Outfit Previews 

Outfit Generator uses the Google Generative AI API to create realistic outfit previews.
This feature is required for the app to work properly.

Important:

You must have a Google Developer account and enable billing on your Google Cloud project.
The API is not free — you’ll be charged per request.

### Step 1: Get an API Key

Go to Google AI Studio.
Sign in with a Google Developer account.

### Step 2: Enable Billing

In your Google Cloud project, make sure billing is turned on.

### Step 3: Add Your Key

Copy your key into the .env file:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

### Step 4 — Restart the App

Once you restart, AI outfit previews will automatically generate as you browse tops and bottoms.
